# Core Features

SwipeMe packs a punch with features that blend messaging mastery, payment power, and creator tools. Here's the lineup:

#### Encrypted Messaging

* 1:1 and group chats with XMTP for true E2E privacy—no servers can peek.
* Rich media: Photos, voice messages (with waveforms and speed controls), locations, and documents.
* Custom vibes: Per-chat backgrounds, themes (light/dark/system), and disappearing messages for that extra layer of control.

#### Instant P2P Payments

* Sub-second settlements on Tempo's dedicated lanes—faster and cheaper than banks (\~$0.001 fees).
* Multi-stablecoin magic: pathUSD, AlphaUSD, BetaUSD, ThetaUSD—swap and send without hassle.

#### Self-Custodial Wallets

* Generate or import wallets with encrypted seed phrases (AES-256-GCM).
* Biometric locks (Face ID/Touch ID) for access and confirms—secure without the fuss.
* Dashboard delight: Real-time balances, transaction history, and easy on-ramps/off-ramps (Ramp integration).

#### Moments: Your Creator Canvas

* TikTok-style video feeds: Upload shorts, swipe through infinite scrolls, autoplay for immersion.
* Engagement unleashed: Likes with animations, encrypted comments, and shares to external apps.
* Monetize magic: Receive stablecoin tips instantly, 90% yours, withdraw anytime.
