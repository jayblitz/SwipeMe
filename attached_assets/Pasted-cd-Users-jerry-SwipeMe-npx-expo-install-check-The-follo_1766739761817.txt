✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating asset fields in /Users/jerry/SwipeMe/app.json:
 Field: Android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage - the file extension should match the content, but the file extension is .png while the file content at './assets/images/android-icon-foreground.png' is of type jpg.
 Field: Android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage - field 'Android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage' should point to .png image but the file at './assets/images/android-icon-foreground.png' has type jpg.
 Field: icon - the file extension should match the content, but the file extension is .png while the file content at './assets/images/icon.png' is of type jpg.
 Field: icon - field 'icon' should point to .png image but the file at './assets/images/icon.png' has type jpg.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

✖ Check for legacy global CLI installed locally
EAS CLI should not be installed in your project. Instead, install it globally or use "npx", "pnpx", or "bunx" depending on your preferred package manager.
Advice:
Remove eas-cli from your project dependencies.

✖ Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: expo-apple-authentication
Required by: @privy-io/expo
Missing peer dependency: expo-application
Required by: @privy-io/expo
Missing peer dependency: expo-crypto
Required by: @privy-io/expo
Missing peer dependency: expo-asset
Required by: expo-audio
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependencies with "npx expo install expo-apple-authentication expo-application expo-crypto expo-asset"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without these dependencies. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.

✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: @xmtp/react-native-sdk
  No metadata available: @privy-io/expo-native-extensions, @videosdk.live/react-native-incallmanager, react-native-passkeys, @videosdk.live/react-native-webrtc
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.

✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
