If you mean **feature parity + production reliability + the “TikTok feel”** (fast start, endless feed, great creator tools, strong recommendations, moderation, monetization), you’re really building a **video + ML + safety + ads** platform, not just an app.

Below is the “real TikTok” blueprint: what you need, how the systems fit together, and the order I’d build it so it becomes a cohesive product (not a pile of features).

---

## What “just like TikTok” actually includes

### Creator-side

* Capture/upload, trimming, multi-clip timeline
* Effects (AR), filters, stickers, captions/subtitles, voice effects
* Music library + licensed audio + “use this sound” flows
* Drafts, scheduled posts, visibility controls
* Creator analytics (views, retention, followers gained, RPM if monetized)
* Live streaming + live chat + gifts (later but “TikTok-like” eventually expects it)

### Viewer-side

* Full-screen vertical swipe feed
* Autoplay, instant start, adaptive quality, loop
* Like/comment/share/favorite, follow/unfollow
* Comment moderation, pin, replies, @mentions
* Search (accounts, sounds, hashtags, videos)
* Notifications (push + in-app)
* DMs (optional, but most apps add it)

### Platform-side (the hard parts)

* **Video pipeline** (upload → transcode → package → CDN)
* **Feed + recommendations** (watch-time-driven ML ranking)
* **Trust & Safety** (copyright, nudity/violence, minors, spam, reporting + human review)
* **Experimentation** (feature flags + A/B testing; TikTok is basically continuous experimentation)
* **Monetization** (ads + creator payouts + anti-fraud)

---

## Reference architecture (real, scalable)

### 1) Clients

* iOS / Android (native video is strongly recommended)
* Web (less critical at first, but TikTok has it)

Key client capabilities:

* Preload next video, keep only 1–2 decoders active
* ABR playback (adaptive bitrate)
* Local caching + quick resume
* Telemetry: startup time, buffering, watch time, drop-offs

---

### 2) Core backend services (split by responsibility)

Think “microservices eventually,” but you can start as a modular monolith with clear boundaries.

* **Identity**: auth, sessions/JWT, device binding
* **Users & Profiles**
* **Social Graph**: follows/blocks/mutes
* **Content**: posts metadata, captions, hashtags, sounds, privacy
* **Media**: signed uploads, processing state, playback manifests
* **Engagement**: likes/favorites/shares
* **Comments**: threads, ranking, moderation tools
* **Feed**: candidate generation + ranking + pagination + dedupe
* **Search**: videos/users/hashtags/sounds
* **Notifications**: push + in-app inbox
* **Moderation**: automated + human review + enforcement
* **Ads/Monetization** (later but real TikTok-level needs it)

---

### 3) Data layer (what stores what)

You won’t get TikTok behavior from a single Postgres DB.

**OLTP (truth):**

* Postgres/MySQL (users, posts, follows edges, settings)

**High-throughput / scalable reads:**

* **Redis** (caching, rate limits, session/presence, counters)
* **Wide-column store** (Cassandra/ScyllaDB/DynamoDB) for feed timelines, event logs, counters at scale
* **Search index** (OpenSearch/Elastic) for text + hashtag + account search

**Analytics & ML training:**

* Kafka/Pulsar (event stream)
* Data lake (S3/GCS) + warehouse (BigQuery/Snowflake) or ClickHouse for near-real-time analytics
* Feature store (Feast/Tecton) if you’re serious about ML

---

## The video pipeline (this is non-negotiable)

### Upload & processing

1. Client requests **signed upload URLs**
2. Client uploads raw video directly to object storage (S3/GCS/R2)
3. Backend emits a job: **transcode + package + thumbnails + metadata**
4. Store results (HLS/DASH manifests, MP4 fallbacks, thumbnails) + mark post “ready”

### Playback formats

* **HLS (adaptive)** is the TikTok standard experience (fast start, network adaptation)
* Multiple bitrates + resolutions
* Generate a **poster thumbnail** and optionally a short animated preview

### Delivery

* Put a **CDN** in front of media (Cloudflare/Akamai/Fastly/CloudFront)
* Ensure **byte-range** and good cache headers
* Track QoE: time-to-first-frame, rebuffer rate, average bitrate, stall %

If your videos don’t start near-instantly, everything else suffers (retention collapses).

---

## The feed & recommendation system (TikTok’s real secret)

### What you must collect (events)

At minimum:

* impression (video shown)
* watch time, completion %, rewatch, skip-in-1s
* like/comment/share/follow
* “not interested,” report
* device/network signals (for QoE)

This event stream is the foundation.

### Ranking system components

A TikTok-class feed is usually:

1. **Candidate generation**

* follows’ content
* trending/viral candidates
* similar-to-viewed (content embeddings)
* location/language relevance
* exploration pool (new creators)

2. **Ranking model**

* predicts watch time / completion / engagement
* uses user embeddings + video embeddings + context (time of day, session length)

3. **Re-ranking / constraints**

* diversity (not same creator 10 times)
* freshness, dedupe, fatigue
* safety filters (age, sensitive topics)
* session-based exploration (multi-armed bandit style)

### Serving (real-time)

* Online inference service (Triton/TF Serving/TorchServe)
* Aggressive caching
* Fall back to heuristic ranking if models fail

You can *start* simple, but “real TikTok” means you invest heavily here.

## Trust, Safety, and Copyright (also non-negotiable)

To operate at TikTok-like scale, you need:

### Pre- and post-upload moderation

* File/type checks, malware scanning
* Automated classifiers: nudity, violence, hate, minors safety, scams
* Text moderation for captions/comments (profanity, hate, harassment)
* Hash-matching for known illegal content
* Reporting system + human review queues + SLAs
* Enforcement engine: warnings, takedowns, shadow limits, bans, appeals

### Copyright & music licensing

TikTok’s music experience is built on licensing deals. If you want “just like TikTok”:

* either secure music licensing agreements, **or**
* restrict to royalty-free / creator-uploaded original audio, **or**
* integrate a licensed music provider with usage controls

If you skip this, you won’t get the “sounds” ecosystem that makes TikTok feel like TikTok.

---

## Real-time features (live + chat + notifications)

### Notifications (must)

* Push: FCM (Android) + APNs (iOS)
* In-app notification inbox
* Rate limits + digesting + anti-spam

### Live streaming (TikTok-like later stage)

* Ingest: RTMP/SRT
* Transcode: multiple renditions
* Serve: LL-HLS (low-latency HLS)
* Live chat: WebSockets + moderation + anti-spam
* Gifts/payments: fraud detection + compliance

---

## Monetization & creator economy (what “real product” implies)

To match TikTok-class business/product depth:

* Ads: auctions, targeting, budgets, pacing, measurement
* Creator monetization: tips, subscriptions, rev share, creator marketplace
* Payouts: KYC, tax forms, chargebacks, fraud models

This is a whole platform by itself.

---

## Engineering execution: how to build it without collapsing

If you try to “build everything” as one blob, it dies. The trick is parallel tracks:

### Track A: Video QoE + client feed feel

* vertical pager, preloading, caching, ABR playback, QoE instrumentation

### Track B: Media pipeline + CDN

* signed uploads, transcoding, HLS packaging, thumbnails, edge caching

### Track C: Feed/reco + analytics foundation

* event stream, metrics, first ranking system, experimentation

### Track D: Integrity

* moderation pipeline, reporting, policy enforcement, anti-spam

### Track E: Monetization (once retention is strong)

* ads + creator payouts

## If you want, I can tailor this into a concrete “system design” for SwipeMe

Tell me these 4 things and I’ll respond with an end-to-end architecture diagram (described), service boundaries, and the exact APIs you’d implement:

1. Mobile: **React Native or native iOS/Android?**
2. Cloud: **AWS / GCP / Azure / Cloudflare / other?**
3. Expected scale in year 1: **10k DAU / 100k / 1M+?**
4. Do you want **music/sounds** like TikTok on day 1 (meaning licensing constraints)?

No MVP talk—just the real blueprint, adjusted to your stack and scale.
